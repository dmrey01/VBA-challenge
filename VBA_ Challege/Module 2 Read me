Module 2
Had help from TA's X3
Went over loops with my tutor. 

Went to turn in my Module last night, system crashed after running last code.  Lost some of my code.  Let Iesha know at 145am could not finsh and would need to get some sleep for work. Would turn it in tomorrow night (AKA tonight) after I got off work.

Ended up working 16 hour shift due to short staff.  Tried to finish as much as I could. Spoke to instructor. We discussed to turn in as much as I could.
